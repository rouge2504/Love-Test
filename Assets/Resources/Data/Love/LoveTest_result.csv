YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GOOD FRIEND,"You would seem to be a FRIENDLY type in your romantic aspirations: you're looking for a partner who will also be a good friend to you. Which of course is what everybody should be looking for, but don't forget that it's not the only thing you should look for; we've all got plenty of friends, but we don't think they would all be suitable as partners! Don't neglect to keep looking out for that spark as well!",resized
RATIONAL!,"In the love department, you stray away from the cliche. Your thinking is rational when it comes to dealing with your partner, and though relationships are meaningful to you, you are not that romantic. You prefer to have more unique, off-the-beaten-trail experiences with your guy, which can quite a good thing! Don't be afraid to embrace your girlier side.",images-of-love-images-for-love-free-pc-wallpapers-saxony-blue-clip-art-for-students-360x360
